Initial Observation
  Restaurants returned null on running server
Hypothesis
  List was not returning valid output
Prediction
  Checking methods returning lists, and empty List if not restaurants
Experiment
  Changed findAllRestaurantsCloseFromDb method to check for no restaurants
Observe
  [ACCEPTED] Method now returns empty list if no restaurants and not null.


Initial Observation
  Test RestaurantAutoWiring throws error
Hypothesis
  Error shows not registered parameter this is an @Autowiring issue
Prediction
  Providing a default ObjectMapper that can be Autowired through DI might solve the issue
Experiment
  Found the config/ObjectMapperBeanConfig, thus making it default ObjectMapper configuration.
  Added @Configuration to class and @Bean on method to provide ObjectMapper. Then added @ExtendWith
  SpringExtension to enable test Junit extension in Spring. Then added @ContextConfiguration to add
  ObjectConfiguration
  parameters.
Observe
[FIXED] All tests running after fixing @Autowire parameter

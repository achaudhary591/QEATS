1. Add breakpoints at DI points to check if dependencies exist or not. Also if context of Spring is
available or not.
2. Searching the exact error is very helpful. Like No ParameterResolver was found in this case,
hence we needed to resolve parameter before starting.
3. Build a logical flow of dependency and see if those are created before we use them.
4. Read a lot of documentation of annotations being used. Like Configuration, Bean, Autowire etc.
